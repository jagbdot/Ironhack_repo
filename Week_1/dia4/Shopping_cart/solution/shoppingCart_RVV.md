#Shopping Cart

##Iteration 1

I created a Shop Class which will have all the logic. Including a check_product function which checks product existance, and adds it to stock. To find a product, IÂ´ve created an array simulating our stock, and then I compare each item with the product the user is looking for. 

##Iteration 2

I made a function (apply discounts) to count the number of duplicated products, then apply the discount in base of this numbers and finally show it on the screen.

##Iteration 3

A function to determinate the season, based on the Date class, and a hash simulating a database of product to access to the current product.
